In the provided goal model, we can identify independent explicit designed variation points in each classifier agent by looking for strategic decisions that allow developers to choose from alternative variants related to specific system assets. Here are the identified variation points for each classifier agent:

1. YOLO Detector:
   - Interpretation to be carried out: This goal represents a variation point where developers can choose different ways to interpret data.
   - Accuracy: Developers can choose different levels of accuracy as a variant in achieving the interpretation goal.
   - Response time: Variants can be chosen based on different response time requirements for the interpretation task.
   - Interpret normal scene and Interpret scene with obstructions: These tasks represent variation points where different approaches can be taken to interpret different types of scenes.

2. Cameras System:
   - Live channel activated: This goal can be considered a variation point where developers can choose to activate live channels in different ways.
   - Provide video stream: Variants can be selected for providing video streams based on different requirements.
   - Image interpretation be carried out: This goal represents a variation point in how image interpretation is performed within the system.

3. RCNN Detector:
   - Interpretation to be carried out: Similar to the YOLO detector, this goal provides a variation point for choosing different interpretation methods.
   - Accuracy and Response time: These quality goals offer variants for achieving different levels of accuracy and response time.
   - Image be available: Developers can choose different ways to make images available for interpretation.
   - Interpret normal scene and Interpret scene with obstructions: Similar to the YOLO detector, these tasks represent variation points for interpreting different types of scenes.

These identified variation points in each classifier agent allow for adaptability and customization in the system configuration based on specific requirements and preferences.
