In the provided goal model, we can identify the independent explicit designed variation points in each classifier agent by looking for goals or tasks that represent alternative variants that can be chosen during system development. Here are the identified variation points for each classifier agent:

1. YOLO detector:
   - Interpret normal scene
   - Interpret scene with obstructions

2. Cameras system:
   - Live channel activated
   - Provide video stream

3. RCNN detector:
   - Interpret normal scene
   - Interpret scene with obstructions

These identified tasks or goals represent variation points where alternative variants can be selected based on specific requirements or conditions during system development.
