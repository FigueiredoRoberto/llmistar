In the provided goal model, we have three classifier agents: YOLO detector, Cameras system, and RCNN detector. To detect independent explicit designed variation points in each classifier agent, we need to identify the specific goals, tasks, and dependencies that represent these variation points.

1. YOLO detector:
   - Variation Points:
     - Interpretation be carried out
     - Interpret normal scene
     - Interpret scene with obstructions
   - Dependencies:
     - Labeled image
     - Image be available
     - Image be interpreted

2. Cameras system:
   - Variation Points:
     - Live channel activated
     - Provide video stream
   - Dependencies:
     - Video stream
     - Labeled image
     - Image interpretation be carried out

3. RCNN detector:
   - Variation Points:
     - Interpretation be carried out
     - Interpret normal scene
     - Interpret scene with obstructions
   - Dependencies:
     - Labeled image
     - Image be available
     - Image be interpreted

These variation points represent the choices or alternatives that can be made within each classifier agent to achieve specific goals or tasks. By identifying these variation points, engineers can make informed decisions about the design and configuration of the system components associated with each agent.
