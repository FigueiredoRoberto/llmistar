In the provided goal model, the independent explicit designed variation points in each classifier agent can be identified as follows:

1. **YOLO Detector**:
   - Variation Point 1: Interpretation be carried out
   - Variation Point 2: Interpret normal scene
   - Variation Point 3: Interpret scene with obstructions
   - Variation Point 4: Accuracy
   - Variation Point 5: Response time
   - Variation Point 6: Image be available

2. **Cameras System**:
   - Variation Point 1: Live channel activated
   - Variation Point 2: Provide video stream
   - Variation Point 3: Image interpretation be carried out

3. **RCNN Detector**:
   - Variation Point 1: Interpretation be carried out
   - Variation Point 2: Accuracy
   - Variation Point 3: Response time
   - Variation Point 4: Image be available
   - Variation Point 5: Interpret normal scene
   - Variation Point 6: Interpret scene with obstructions

These variation points represent the specific aspects or features that can be customized or varied independently within each classifier agent in the goal model.
